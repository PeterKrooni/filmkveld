# Filmkveld

A web application for organization of movie nights



## Key features 

"Filmkveld" aims to solve the problem of organisation of "movie nights". The application keeps track of what movies have been watched by a collective, and showes who attened a given movie night, what movies where watched, and who suggested each movie. In addition every movie suggestion can be given a downvote or an upvote by each user that attended the movie night afer the collective/group has watched that movie, this affects the "taste" score of the user that suggested the movie.


## Project goal

The goal of the prioject is to get well aquinted and familiar with production of a modern full stack web application. We aim to get familier with modern component based frontend frameworks and how to ustilise them. We also aim to get familair with Node.js as our choice of backend technology.




## Tech stack

We have choosen to use the [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) tech stack for this project. We also aim to use Typescript for type safety as well as TailwindCSS for CSS utility.
